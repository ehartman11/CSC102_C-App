# CSC102_C-App
This project is the culmination of CSC202 which featured application building in Visual Studio 2022 using C#.
As an introductory course to C#, the final project was to utilize examples of basic programming techniques, 
to include class instantiation, arrays, object typing, methods, loops, conditionals, and exception handling. 
The objective of the project was to create a simple moonbase with rooms the user could travel between using navigation buttons. 
Each room includes a photo, description and a title. 
I also created a map of the base using Tiled that the user could also access to move about. 
This is a very simplistic application but displays creativity in its design.
